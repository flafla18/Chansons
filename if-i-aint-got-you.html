  <h1>If I Ain’t Got You</h1>

  <div class="strophe">
        <pre>
Some people live for the fortune
Some people live just for the fame
Some people live for the power, yeah
Some people live just to play the game


Some people think that the physical things
Define what's within
And I've been there before, but that life's a bore
So full of the superficial


Some people want it all
But I don't want nothin' at all
If it ain't you, baby
If I ain't got you, baby
Some people want diamond rings
Some just want everything
But everything means nothin'
If I ain't got you, yeah

Some people search for a fountain
That promises forever young (Ya know)
Some people need three dozen roses
And that's the only way to prove you love them


Hand me the world on a silver platter
And what good would it be?
With no one to share
With no one who truly cares for me


Some people want it all
But I don't want nothin' at all
If it ain't you, baby
If I ain't got you, baby
Some people want diamond rings
Some just want everything
But everything means nothin'
If I ain't got you, you, you
Some people want it all
But I don't want nothin' at all
If it ain't you, baby
If I ain't got you, baby
Some people want diamond rings
Some just want everything
But everything means nothin'
If I ain't got you, yeah

If I ain't got you with me, baby
Oh, ooh
Said nothin' in this whole wide world don't mean a thing
If I ain't got you with me, baby
