  <h1>I'm So Excited</h1>

  <div class="strophe">
        <pre>
Tonight's the night we're gonna make it happen
Tonight, we'll put all other things aside
Give in this time and show me some affection
We're going for those pleasures in the night


I want to love you, feel you
Wrap myself around you
I want to squeeze you, please you
I just can't get enough
And if you move real slow, I'll let it go


I'm so excited, and I just can't hide it
I'm about to lose control, and I think I like it
I'm so excited, and I just can't hide it
And I know, I know, I know, I know
I know I want you


We shouldn't even think about tomorrow
Sweet memories will last a long, long time
We'll have a good time, baby, don't you worry
And if we're still playing 'round, boy, that's just fine


Let's get excited, we just can't hide it
I'm about to lose control and I think I like it
I'm so excited, and I just can't hide it
I know, I know, I know, I know
I know I want you, I want you, I want you


Oh boy, I want to love you, feel you
Honey, wrap myself around you
I want to squeeze you, please you
No, I just can't get enough
And if you move real slow, I'll let it go


I'm so excited, and I just can't hide it
I'm about to lose control and I think I like it
I'm so excited, and I just can't hide it
I know, I know, I know, I know
I know I want you, want you


I'm so excited (Look what you do to me)
And I just can't hide it (You’ve got me burning up)
I'm about to lose control and I think I like it (Oh, oh, oh, oh, ow!)
I'm so excited (How did you get to me?)
And I can't deny it (I’ve got to give it up)
I know (Oh, oh, oh, oh ow!)
I know I want you
I'm so excited (Look what you do to me)
Oh, boy (You’ve got me burning up)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, ow!
I'm so excited
(How did you get to me?)
Look at me (I’ve got to give it up)
Oh, oh, oh, oh ow!
I'm so excited
(Look what you do to me, you’ve got me burning up)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, ow!
