  <h1>Everything I Do</h1>

  <div class="strophe">
        <pre>
Look into my eyes, you will see
What you mean to me
Search your heart, search your soul
And when you find me there, you'll search no more

Don't tell me it's not worth tryin' for
You can't tell me it's not worth dyin' for
You know it's true
Everything I do, I do it for you

Look into your heart, you will find
There's nothin' there to hide
Take me as I am, take my life
I would give it all, I would sacrifice

Don't tell me it's not worth fightin' for
I can't help it, there's nothin' I want more
You know it's true
Everything I do, I do it for you
Oh, yeah

There's no love like your love
And no other could give more love
There's nowhere unless you're there
All the time, all the way, yeah

Look into your heart, babe
Yeah!
Oh, yeah!

Oh, you can't tell me it's not worth tryin' for
I can't help it, there's nothin' I want more
Yeah, I would fight for you, I'd lie for you
Walk the wire for you, yeah, I'd die for you

You know it's true
Everything I do
Oh
I do it for you

Everything I do, darling
And we'll see it through
We will see it through, oh, yeah
Yeah!
Search your heart, search your soul
You can't tell me it ain't worth dying for, oh, yeah!
I'll be there, yeah, oh!
I'll walk the wire for you, yeah!
I will die for you
Oh, yeah!
All the time
I'm going all the way, all the way, yeah
Take me by the hand
Ow!
