  <h1>Hit The Road Jack</h1>

  <div class="strophe">
        <pre>

Hit the road, Jack, and don't ya come back
No more, no more, no more, no more
Hit the road, Jack, and don't ya come back no more
What'd you say?
Hit the road, Jack, and don't ya come back
No more, no more, no more, no more
Hit the road, Jack, and don't ya come back no more

Old woman, old woman, don't treat me so mean
You're the meanest old woman that I've ever seen
I guess if you say so
I'll have to pack my things and go (That's right)

Hit the road, Jack, and don't ya come back
No more, no more, no more, no more
Hit the road, Jack, and don't ya come back no more
What'd you say?
Hit the road, Jack, and don't ya come back
No more, no more, no more, no more
Hit the road, Jack, and don't ya come back no more

Now, baby, listen, baby, don't you treat me this-a way
'Cause I'll be back on my feet someday
Don't care if you do, cause it's understood
You ain't got no money, you just ain't no good
Well, I guess if you say so
I'll have to pack my things and go (That's right)

Hit the road, Jack, and don't ya come back
No more, no more, no more, no more
Hit the road, Jack, and don't ya come back no more
What'd you say?
Hit the road, Jack, and don't ya come back
No more, no more, no more, no more
Hit the road, Jack, and don't ya come back no more

Well (Don't ya come back no more)
Uh, what'd you say? (Don't ya come back no more)
I didn't understand you (Don't ya come back no more)
You can't mean that (Don't ya come back no more)
Oh, now, baby, please (Don't ya come back no more)
What you're trying to do to me? (Don't ya come back no more)
