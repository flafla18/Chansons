  <h1>I'm still standing</h1>

        <pre>
            You could never know what it's like
            Your blood, like winter, freezes just like ice
            And there's a cold, lonely light that shines from you
            You'll wind up like the wreck you hide behind that mask you use
            
            And did you think this fool could never win?
            Well look at me, I'm a-coming back again
            I got a taste of love in a simple way
            And if you need to know while I'm still standing
            You just fade away
            
            Don't you know I'm still standing better than I ever did?
            Looking like a true survivor, feeling like a little kid
            And I'm still standing after all this time
            Picking up the pieces of my life without you on my mind
            
            I'm still standing (yeah, yeah, yeah)
            I'm still standing (yeah, yeah, yeah)
            
            Once I never coulda hoped to win
            You starting down the road, leaving me again
            The threats you made were meant to cut me down
            And if our love was just a circus
            You'd be a clown by now
            
            You know I'm still standing better than I ever did
            Looking like a true survivor, feeling like a little kid
            I'm still standing after all this time
            Picking up the pieces of my life without you on my mind
            
            I'm still standing (yeah, yeah, yeah)
            I'm still standing (yeah, yeah, yeah)
            
            Don't you know that I'm still standing better than I ever did?
            Looking like a true survivor, feeling like a little kid
