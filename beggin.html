  <h1>Beggin'</h1>

  <div class="strophe">
        <pre>
Put your lovin' hand out, baby
'Cause I'm beggin'

I'm beggin', beggin' you
So put your lovin' hand out, baby
I'm beggin', beggin' you
So put your loving hand out, darlin'


Ridin' high when I was king
I played it hard and fast 'cause I had everything
I walked away, you warned me then
But easy come and easy go, and it would end

So anytime I bleed, you let me go
Yah, anytime I feed, you get me, no
Anytime I seek, you let me know
But I plant and seed, just let me go
I'm on my knees when I'm beggin'
'Cause I don't wanna lose you
Hey, yeah, ra-ta-ta-ta!


'Cause I'm beggin', beggin' you
Uh, put your lovin' hand out, baby
I'm beggin', beggin' you, ah
And put your lovin' hand out, darlin'



I need you to understand
Tried so hard to be your man
The kind of man you want in the end
Only then can I begin to live again


An empty shell, I used to be
The shadow of my life was hangin' over me
A broken man that I don't know
Won't even stand the devil's dance to win my soul


What we doin'? What we chasin'?
Why the bottom? Why the basement?
Why we got good shit, don't embrace it?
Why the feel for the need to replace me?
You're the wrong way track from the good
I wanna paint a picture tellin' where we could be at
Like a heart in the best way should
You can give it away, you had it, and you took the pay
But I keep walkin' on, keep openin' doors
Keep hopin' for, now the door is yours
Keep also home
'Cause I don't wanna live in a broken home, girl, I'm beggin'


Mmm, yeah, yeah, I'm beggin', beggin' you
So put your lovin' hand out, baby
I'm beggin', beggin' you
So put your lovin' hand out, darlin'


I'm fightin' hard to hold my own
Just can't make it all alone
I'm holdin' on, I can't fall back
I'm just a calm, 'bout to fade to black


I'm beggin', beggin' you
Put your lovin' hand out, baby
I'm beggin', beggin' you
So put your lovin' hand out, darlin'
I'm beggin', beggin' you
So put your lovin' hand out, baby
I'm beggin', beggin' you
So put your lovin' hand out, darlin'


I'm beggin', beggin' you
So put your lovin' hand out, baby
I'm beggin', beggin' you
So put your lovin' hand out
